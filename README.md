# TerraVision_Project
TerraVision, we are on a mission to revolutionize farming with smart technology. We believe in the power of smart farming to transform Nepalâ€™s agriculture. Despite being an agricultural country with vast farmlands and hardworking farmers, Nepal still imports vegetables and crops from neighboring countries. This is not because we lack resources but because many farmers do not have access to modern farming techniques and scientific insights about their soil and climate.

Thatâ€™s where TerraVision comes in! ðŸŒ±

Our mission is to empower farmers with data-driven solutions to help them make better farming decisions. With TerraVision, farmers can easily analyze their soil and climate conditions by entering key details such as:

âœ” Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels

âœ” Soil pH value

âœ” Temperature & humidity

âœ” Rainfall and climate conditions

Using this information, our system predicts the best crops suited for their land, ensuring higher yields, healthier soil, and more profitable farming.
